I have years of experience crafting web applications with various technologies. This experience has given me a passion for beautiful, readable and tidy code, paying close attention to what the correct modeling would be, and understanding the science behind the tools I use. I also enjoy studying new ways to improve my skills and productivity, decreasing technical debt, and contributing to opensource projects. As a peoples person, I enjoy working with others, from junior to senior level.

Currently, I'm more focused on crafting web solutions or data science applications with Ruby, Elixir, and/or JS
